          "Walt Disney (1901-1966) was an American entrepreneur who did innovating work in animations and cartoon production but not only was he skilled at his craft, he built a billion dollar business off of making cartoons from his garage. Today, Disney is one of the most recognized names in the world as a company which owns multiple productions as well as toys. \n\nWalt Disney was a man of determination and perseverance as can be seen even before everything, when at the age of 16, he fought in World War One, and even then he had a creative spirit because he customized his ambulance with his personal cartoon drawings.\n At first, he had an advertising job & most people would consider themselves lucky to have one, but this man had the desire to achieve so he left that job to start a business alongside his brother in a garage. Normally, people are scared of this kind of risk taking but he followed his passion even though it meant being unemployed.\n\n Eventually, they even got a good contract with another company by the name of Universal for which they made cartoons but when they realized that they weren’t really valued as anything more than hired labour, he made another risky decision to leave the company alongside his created cartoon as Universal had the rights for them but with determination & desire he pushed forward.\n\n This is where Disney relied on his creativeness again & went on to produce the well recognized character that we know today as Micky Mouse. However, times were changing & with the advent of sound in Hollywood, he reworked his creation with the implementation of sound. Steamboat Willie, released in 1928, was the first animated film to feature synchronized sound. This was an international success but he did not stop there, he still had that desire to improve.\n\n Disney kept on implementing the newest technologies that came out to his cartoons and made colour cartoons that won him an Academy Award in 1932. He also went on to win 26 Oscars over his career & also started working on feature films and released Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs which was the first feature-length animated movie to be produced in Technicolor and cost nearly \$1.5 million to make.",
